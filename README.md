## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

This project helped me solidify my understanding of the css box model, I also worked with svg imagess and i learnt how to incorparate them into my code using the  <svg> tag.I also worked with the hover function which helped me explore an element having two states and being different in both states.


```html
<img id="img" src="assets/images/image-avatar.webp" alt="Author photo">
```
```css
.badge{
    background-color: #f4d04e;
    color: #000000;
    font-size: 12px;
    font-weight: bold;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    padding: 4px 8px;
    border-radius: 4px;
    display: inline-block;
    margin-bottom: 8px;
    margin-left: 16px;
}
```

```


### Continued development

I would like to improve my css and manipulating html elements to be 100% the same as the figma file, I struggled alot with that.
